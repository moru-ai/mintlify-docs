Moru captures logs from sandbox execution, including commands run, stdout, stderr, and exit codes.

## Viewing Logs in the Dashboard

The easiest way to view sandbox logs is through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to [moru.io/dashboard](https://moru.io/dashboard)
2. Go to the **Sandboxes** tab
3. Click on any sandbox row to view its logs

### What You'll See

When you click on a sandbox, you'll see:

- **Commands executed**: Each command appears as `$ command`
- **stdout**: Standard output from commands (highlighted in blue)
- **stderr**: Error output from commands (highlighted in red)
- **Exit codes**: The exit code for each command

You can filter logs by type (stdout or stderr) using the dropdown, and copy all logs with the "Copy all" button.

### Managing Running Sandboxes

If a sandbox is currently running, you can kill it directly from the logs view using the **Kill** button. This immediately terminates the sandbox and frees up resources.

## Log Retention

Logs are retained for 7 days.

Need longer retention? Contact us at [hi@moru.io](mailto:hi@moru.io).

<Note>
  Logs are associated with sandbox IDs. Once a sandbox is terminated, logs remain accessible for the retention period.
