Moru provides isolated cloud sandboxes for AI agents that need full computer access—like [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview)—to run commands, write files, and execute code.

## Why Moru?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hardware Isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Each sandbox runs in its own Firecracker microVM, providing strong security isolation between workloads.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Environment" icon="terminal">
    Complete Linux environment with filesystem, networking, and command execution - everything your agent needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time Streaming" icon="bolt">
    Stream command output, file changes, and logs in real-time as your agent works.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Persistence" icon="floppy-disk">
    Pause and resume sandboxes to maintain agent state across sessions.

## Quick Example

Create a sandbox, run a command, and read the output:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from moru import Sandbox

# Create a sandbox
sandbox = Sandbox.create()

# Run a command
result = sandbox.commands.run("echo 'Hello from Moru!'")
print(result.stdout)  # Hello from Moru!

# Clean up
sandbox.kill()
```

```javascript JavaScript
import Sandbox from '@moru-ai/core'

// Create a sandbox
const sandbox = await Sandbox.create()

// Run a command
const result = await sandbox.commands.run("echo 'Hello from Moru!'")
console.log(result.stdout)  // Hello from Moru!

// Clean up
await sandbox.kill()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Core Concepts

### Sandboxes

A sandbox is an isolated compute environment where your agent can safely execute code, manipulate files, and run commands. Each sandbox:

- Runs in a dedicated Firecracker microVM
- Has its own filesystem (10 GB default)
- Can execute arbitrary shell commands
- Supports network access (configurable)
- Auto-terminates after a timeout (default 5 minutes)

### Templates

Templates define the starting state of a sandbox - the base image, installed packages, and startup configuration. Use built-in templates or create custom ones with your specific dependencies.

### Files and Commands

Sandboxes provide full access to:
- **Filesystem operations**: Read, write, list, watch files and directories
- **Command execution**: Run shell commands with streaming output
- **PTY support**: Interactive terminal sessions for REPL environments

## Use Cases

Moru is designed for AI agent workloads:

- **Code execution agents**: Run code generated by LLMs in isolated environments
- **Development assistants**: Provide agents with full development environments
- **Data processing**: Execute data transformation pipelines securely
- **Testing and CI**: Run tests in clean, reproducible environments
