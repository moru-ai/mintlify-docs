## FAQ

### How is compute time calculated?

Compute time is measured in vCPU-hours. A sandbox with 2 vCPUs running for 30 minutes uses 1 vCPU-hour.

### Do paused sandboxes count?

Paused sandboxes (beta) do not consume compute but may have storage costs.

### Are there overage charges?

If you exceed your plan limits, you'll be billed for the additional usage at standard rates.

### Can I set spending limits?

Yes, you can set spending alerts and limits in the dashboard.
