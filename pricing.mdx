Moru uses simple usage-based pricing. Pay only for what you use.

## Usage-Based Pricing

| Resource | Price |
|----------|-------|
| CPU | $0.000014 per vCPU-second |
| RAM | $0.0000045 per GiB-second |

**Example:** A sandbox with 2 vCPUs and 2 GiB RAM running for 1 hour costs approximately $0.14.

## Free Credits

Every new account receives **$3 in free credits** to get started. No credit card required.

## Billing

### View Usage

1. Go to [moru.io/dashboard](https://moru.io/dashboard)
2. Click **Billing** in the sidebar
3. View current usage and remaining credits

### Can I set spending limits?

Yes, you can set spending limits in the dashboard to control costs.

## Need More Compute?

All accounts have the same resource limits. If you need higher limits (more concurrent sandboxes, longer duration, more vCPUs/RAM), contact us at [hi@moru.io](mailto:hi@moru.io).
